# ASF-DiscordBot
Do you want to use Discord instead of Steam to send commands to your bots? ASF-DiscordBot is for you!

YOU NEED TO ENABLE IPC ON ASF!

This bot needs python3.5 with modules discord.py and requests:

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

python3 -m pip install -U requests

In bot_main.py: Replace bot_token_here with your bot token.

In bot_cog.py: Replace bot_master_here with your Discord ID. (right click on your avatar in Developer mode).

Start bot using:

python3 bot_main.py

MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING PYTHON 3.5 OR NEWER.
